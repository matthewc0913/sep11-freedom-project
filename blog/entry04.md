### Learning my tool
In the past month I have been learning my tool Vidcode. How I did this is by thinkering on Vidcode. I have been trying to learn how the videos can work on a website using the code below. The thing is the videcode cannot be converted to an IDE so I will have to use other ways to have a video on an IDE, Github and a website. But with the code below the video can loop, end and play.

#### Code:
```
<video width="320" height="240" controls>
  <source src="movie.mp4" type="video/mp4">
  <source src="movie.ogg" type="video/ogg">
</video>
```
This shows how a video can show on a website. I just need to put in the video link in the source.

## EDP
I am still currently in the second stage of the engineering design process, where the main goal is to research the problem. Why I think I am in this step in the **Engineering Design Process** is I have been researching the problem that I have. The problem that I have is that I need to make a website that can uses elements from Javascript and use it in working website. I have been making progress on research the problem. The next stage is to brainstorm possible solutions to resovle the issue. This is why I am still on the second stage of the **Engineering Design Process.**

## Skills
Some skills that Iâ€™ve learned since working on the last blog are **Creativity**, and **Organization**.

### Creativity
I have never thought I can be creative or orignal. I have never had that type of characteristic in me. But working on my Freedom Project I had the idea to screen record the video I was gonna use for the website by recoding a video through the computer and have the music added on later. I tried recording a video through the computer and I put that recording on Github and now I have it on this repo and you can get it [here](../tool/SeanManeana.webm). This is how I have Creativity.

### Organization
I have always been a unorganized person. But for school and mostly for this computer I have learned to have organized my tabs into folders to each class. This way I can focus on one class at a time. Shifting my focus on to one class can make me more absorbed in the lesson I am learning. For example my SEP folder has websites like:

* Github
* Sep11 Notes
* Hstat Sep students page
* CS50 (IDE)

Now I can feel like I can focus on one class at a time with this trick.


## Next steps
I am looking forward to what comes next for my freedom project!
