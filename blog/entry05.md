### Learning my tool
In the past month I have been learning my tool Vidcode. How I did this is by thinkering on Vidcode. I have been trying to learn how the videos can work on a website using the code below. The thing is the videcode cannot be converted to an IDE so I will have to use other ways to have a video on an IDE, Github and a website. But with the code below the video can loop, end and play.

#### Code:
```
<iframe width="800" height="495" src="SeanManeana.webm" title="Sean Manana" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

```
This shows the video on the website. I just need to put make it look pretty.

### MVP
I finished my MVP by have the code above and downloading a video on my computer and putting he video that I had to the code to make my MVP. What I need to do next is fix the website to add more so it looks better than it does now.

## EDP
I am currently in the fifth of the engineering design process, where the main goal is to create a prototype. Why I think I am in this step in the **Engineering Design Process** is I have been creating a prototype for the project. The problem that I have is that I need to make a website that can uses elements from Javascript and use it in working website. I have been making a websit using the. The next stage is to Test and evaluate the prototype to resovle the issue. This is why I am on the fifth stage of the **Engineering Design Process.**

## Skills
Some skills that Iâ€™ve learned since working on the last blog are **Debugging**, and **How to Google**.

### Debugging
To learn JS I needed to debug code when something did not work. When there are errors in my code I know I did something wrong. Either I can give up or I can try to debug it. What I will do is I will try to see what the problem is and try to debug it but sometimes that does not work. What I do is try to comment out everything until what I want to work works. Now I learn from my mistakes and now debugging an error feels like I learned something and not just debuged the error to fix my mistakes. Now I know how to use debug more effectively.

### How to Google
To learn how to put a video on a website I needed to Google how to do it. When I Google _how to put a video on a website_, I don't want to look at 3 billion results especially the results I have already seen or the results that have nothing to do with putting a video on a website. That is why I have learned that the hyphen (-) tells Google that you do not want pages that contain this word to appear in your results. So I have been use the hyphen in my google searches to help me filter my google searches. Also I typed How to use put a video on a website -tutorial on Google and saw a tutorial which told me how it works and how to effectively use it. Now I know how to use Google more effectively.

## Next steps
I am looking forward to what comes next for my freedom project!
