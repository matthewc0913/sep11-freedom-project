## EDP
I am currently in the fifth of the engineering design process, where the main goal is to create a prototype. Why I think I am in this step in the **Engineering Design Process** is I have been creating a prototype for the project. The problem that I have is that I need to make a website that can uses elements from Javascript and use it in working website. I have been making a websit using the . The next stage is to brainstorm possible solutions to resovle the issue. This is why I am still on the second stage of the **Engineering Design Process.**

## Skills
Some skills that Iâ€™ve learned since working on the last blog are **Debugging**, and **How to Google**.

### Debugging


### How to Google
To learn how to put a video on a website I needed to Google how to do it. When I Google _how to put a video on a website_, I don't want to look at 3 billion results especially the results I have already seen or the results that have nothing to do with putting a video on a website. That is why I have learned that the hyphen (-) tells Google that you do not want pages that contain this word to appear in your results. So I have been use the hyphen in my google searches to help me filter my google searches. Also I typed How to use put a video on a website -tutorial on Google and saw a tutorial which told me how it works and how to effectively use it. Now I know how to use Google more effectively.

## Next steps
I am looking forward to what comes next for my freedom project!
