## EDP
I am currently in the fifth of the engineering design process, where the main goal is to create a prototype. Why I think I am in this step in the **Engineering Design Process** is I have been creating a prototype for the project. The problem that I have is that I need to make a website that can uses elements from Javascript and use it in working website. I have been making a websit using the. The next stage is to Test and evaluate the prototype to resovle the issue and fix problems that I have. This is why I am on the fifth stage of the **Engineering Design Process.**


## Skills
Some skills that Iâ€™ve learned since working on the last blog are **Time management**, and **Creativity**.

### Time management
While working on the website I need to manage my time well. I had to manage time doing this, time with family, time relaxing. So I set curtain days to work on my project. I use [Google Calender](https://calendar.google.com/calendar/u/0/r) to know what days I should be working on my FP. With this scheduling I will learn more about my website and had fun with my family. Now I have learned to balance time to do certain things.

### Creativity
I have never thought I can be creative or orignal. I have never had that type of characteristic in me. But working on my Freedom Project presintations I had the idea to have a bunch of jokes on my presintations. But none of that is original so I had to use creativity to be original. This is how I am original and creative.




## Next steps
I am looking forward to what comes next, next year in 12 grade.
